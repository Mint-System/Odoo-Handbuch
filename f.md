# f

f means file and is a reserved namespace in this knowledge base. Within this namespace you can add a unique number that includes another article. Thus you can reference articles without using the actual name. Here is an example:

I want to link the article [Prozess Entwicklung](Prozess-Entwicklung.md). Instead of using the public url <https://odoo-handbuch.mint-system.ch/#/Prozess-Entwicklung>, which might break in the future, you can create an new file id [[f-1]] and include the article in the id file. Once the id is published you can reference the article by using <https://knowledge.mint-system.ch/#/f-1>.
